# Orbital Framework

To create a new project, run:

```bash
composer create-project orbital-framework/orbital
```

Then, include the desired packages:

```bash
composer require orbital-framework/i18n
composer require orbital-framework/mongodb

Finally, edit your ``app/env.php`` file (don't forget to add this file on ``.gitignore``).

Now develop your app and be happy :)
